# ✅ Task 2 – Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Welcome to **Task 2** of my internship at **Prodigy InfoTech**! This project focused on cleaning and exploring a real-world dataset using Python tools.

## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains the work I completed for **Task 2** of my data science internship. The primary goal was to prepare and analyze the dataset by handling inconsistencies and uncovering meaningful insights.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning

- Identified and handled missing values
- Removed duplicate or inconsistent entries
- Converted data types where necessary
- Ensured overall dataset integrity

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualized variable distributions and relationships
- Uncovered patterns, trends, and potential outliers
- Used statistical summaries to understand key features

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
